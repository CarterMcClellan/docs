Transcription is the process of converting spoken words in audio files into written text. This task is crucial for making audio content accessible, searchable, and analyzable.

Running Transcription with `supercontrast` is simple. You need to provide the audio file (either as a URL or a local file path) and specify the provider you want to use.
In this example, we'll use `Task.TRANSCRIPTION` with `Provider.OPENAI`, which utilizes OpenAI's Whisper API.

```python
from supercontrast import SuperContrastClient, Task, Provider, TranscriptionRequest

client = SuperContrastClient(task=Task.TRANSCRIPTION, providers=[Provider.OPENAI])
request = TranscriptionRequest(audio_file="https://github.com/supercontrast-ai/supercontrast/raw/main/tests/audio/test_transcription.wav")
response, metadata = client.request(request)
```

Each task has its own request and response schema. For `Task.TRANSCRIPTION`, the request schema is defined by `TranscriptionRequest` and the response schema is defined by `TranscriptionResponse`.

[TranscriptionRequest](https://github.com/supercontrast-ai/supercontrast/blob/main/src/supercontrast/task/types/transcription_types.py#L6)

- `audio_file`: a string that can be either a URL to an audio file or a local file path.

[TranscriptionResponse](https://github.com/supercontrast-ai/supercontrast/blob/main/src/supercontrast/task/types/transcription_types.py#L13)

- `text`: a string containing the transcribed text from the audio file.
